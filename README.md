<h1>PCF Service Registry Demo</h1>

Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud FoundryÂ® (PCF) provides your applications with an implementation of the Service Discovery 
pattern, one of the key tenets of a microservice-based architecture. Trying to hand-configure each client of a service or 
adopt some form of access convention can be difficult and prove to be brittle in production. Instead, your applications can use 
the Service Registry to dynamically discover and call registered services

This code is for the blog entry below

```
---
applications:
- name: apples-employee-service
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  host: apples-employee-service-${random-word}
  path: ./target/EmployeeService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
