<h1>PCF Service Registery</h1>

Service Registry for Pivotal Cloud FoundryÂ® (PCF) provides your applications with an implementation of the Service Discovery 
pattern, one of the key tenets of a microservice-based architecture. Trying to hand-configure each client of a service or 
adopt some form of access convention can be difficult and prove to be brittle in production. Instead, your applications can use 
the Service Registry to dynamically discover and call registered services
